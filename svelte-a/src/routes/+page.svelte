<h1>play</h1>

<p>
	This is the first time I will deliberately 'play' with all the features... Rather than simply
	follow along with a tutorial.
</p>

<p>I know Svelte is the right way to go. I need Typescript for a couple of reasons.</p>

<p>
	My health, wealth and Permaculture. To gain enough expertise that I can monitor nutrient control
	in a commercially viable ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
	To harvest fruit trees in a food forest with swarm drones. I want to do so in high trees and dense
	foliage.
</p>

<p>To remove the cheeks of these fruits and plant the seeds in the pith of their forbears.</p>

<p>
	To remain supremely awake not mundanely transferred. To show visual content of animal families
	undisturbed by the harvesting process. To others.
</p>

Yeah to compute the communicative processes of entire ecosystems. To weave the threads of life.
